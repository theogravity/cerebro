## 2.0.1 - Sun May 31 2020 00:52:30

- Add getAssertValue(), Remove type-specific getters (#2)

Type-specific getters turned out to be unnecessary as the YAML parser already does proper type conversion internally.

I was unable to justify keeping them as a result, and removed them to simplify the API.

A new method, `getAssertValue()`, was added to ensure a value exists, and throw if it does not.

Due to the removal of the type-specific getters, the package major version has been updated.

## 1.0.6 - Sat May 30 2020 00:21:04

**Contributor:** Theo Gravity

- Add `getConfigForLabel()`

In `cerebro`, you can assign tags (it calls them `labels`) to settings to group settings under a particular tag.

Although it could do this, its usage was very limited as it does not have a getter to work with them.

The new method allows you to get a set of settings by its tag.
